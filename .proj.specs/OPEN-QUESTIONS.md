# Open questions

Architecture-level decisions that are deferred. Distinct from a ticket with `status: pending`: those
exist and are paused, these are not yet tickets because something upstream has to settle first.

Each entry records why it was deferred, the evidence behind that call, what it blocks, and the
condition that should bring it back. Number them `OQ-001`, `OQ-002`, … and keep resolved ones in
place with their resolution, so the reasoning survives.

Entries follow this shape:

---

## OQ-NNN — <the question, as a question>

**Deferred on:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** open | resolved

**Reason.** Why this cannot be decided yet. Name what has to happen first.

**Evidence.** What is already known, with `path:line`, command output, or an external source for
each claim. Say which claims are verified and which are inferred.

**Blocks.** What downstream decisions or pipeline stages wait on this. List the candidate options
already ruled in or out.

**Not blocked.** What is already settled despite this question being open, so the deferral does not
stall more than it has to.

**Revisit when.** The condition that should bring this back — not a date, a state.
